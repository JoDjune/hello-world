# hello-world
This is my first repository!
This is the first time I'm using GitHub and so far it's awesome! Friends use all sorts of nicknames to call me, so you can freely call me Djune. I am a software engineer to be, and I'm hoping to become a major in areas that I'm most interested in. I love coffee, coffee rocks!
